minesweeper
===========
This was my grade 11 computer science summative.
There are lots of great features here.
You can save the game, which will create a textfile with the information about where your game is currently.
To save, you need to leave the allegro screen and go to the .exe file to enter a username to save under.
(EDIT: this seems to be broken - I'm pretty sure the project I have on here isn't the copy I submitted to my teacher,
however I'm not quite sure where the better copy is - there was a timer, and even a two player option... 
also it wouldn't let you lose on first click)

The instructions on how to play are in the game - if you've never played before, it's tons of fun! 
Good luck!
